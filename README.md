# Data-Science-Projects
Some fun Data Science projects that I conducted during my Master's.

1. The EDA of Spotify Top 200 Charts (2020-2021) involves a project I carried out to
   explore, analyse and visualise the Spotify Top 200 Charts of 2020 to 2021 using Exploratory Data Analysis.
   The Google Colab Notebook is attached and the analysis was conducted using Python.

2. The Global Cost of Living project involves the usage of Python to conduct a simple analysis on the global cost of
   living data set obtained from Kaggle. The main objectives are to compute and provide a brief overview on the
   descriptive statistics of the global cost of living across salary and selected expenses, to determine whether
   mean or median is a better measure to make comparisons for the cost of living based on the presence of outliers, and
   to determine countries with the highest cost of living based on certain expenses.
   The Google Colab Notebook and report in pdf format are attached.

3. The Google Colab Notebook on NumPy ndarray Along with Examples of Unary Ufuncs and Binary Universal Functions contains
   examples of basic functions using NumPy.
